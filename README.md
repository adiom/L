# L / R

In early 2015, I dove into the whirlpool of my consciousness to craft drafts for this work, yet it never took the shape I longed for. Time passed, and I realized that completing it in its original form would be like firing a bullet into the sky and hoping to hit the Moon. So, I let two of my projects—a novella, L, and the story Love as Long as R—merge into a single stream.

Thus, L / R was born—not as a compromise, but as a new point of convergence where past and present meet like a tractor and a plow carving new paths through the field of possibility.
